## The reFit Jenkins Plugin ##

You can integrate reFit with [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) and browse Fit test results and summaries via the Jenkins web interface. See the [reFit Plugin page](http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/reFit+Plugin) in the Jenkins wiki for details.

The reFit plugin is available from the Jenkins update centre and can be installed from the Jenkins web interface in the usual way.

The sources and releases of the plugin are hosted on the Jenkins infrastructure and not as part of this project.
