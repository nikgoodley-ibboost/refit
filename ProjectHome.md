## What is reFit? ##

reFit is an enhanced version of the [Framework for Integrated Test](http://fit.c2.com/) (Fit) created by Ward Cunningham.

[Fit in a Nutshell](FitInANutshell.md) gives you an idea of what Fit is all about.

## Goals ##

The aim of reFit is to enhance Fit with [Dependency Injection](DependencyInjectionForFit.md) for Java EE 6, Spring and OSGi, [JUnit adapters](FitWithJUnit.md), [Maven integration](RunningFitTests.md), Logging, Javadoc and other things to increase the usability of this framework both for developers and end users.

reFit is based on the latest (unreleased) snapshot of Fit from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fit) from 2008.


## Non-Goals ##

reFit does not include any of the Fit extensions from [Fitnesse](http://fitnesse.org). In particular, reFit focuses on Java for fixture implementations and HTML for test cases.
